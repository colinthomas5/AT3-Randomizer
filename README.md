# AT3 Randomizer

Item randomizer for Adventure Time: Secret of the Nameless Kingdom.

## Getting Started

In preparation to randomize your AT3 copy, backup your vanilla data folder from your AT3 installation for when you wish to return to a vanilla game state. Alternatively, you may clone your AT3 installation and dedicate one installation to the vanilla game and one installation to randomizer.

## Randomization

To randomize your AT3 copy...

```
$ Run at3_random.exe
$ Point the program to the data folder you wish to randomize
$ The program will randomize the files within the data folder
```
