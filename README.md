# AT3 Randomizer

Item randomizer for Adventure Time: Secret of the Nameless Kingdom.

## Getting Started

In preparation to randomize your AT3 copy, backup your vanilla data folder from your AT3 installation for when you wish to return to a vanilla game state. Alternatively, you may clone your AT3 installation and dedicate one installation to the vanilla game and one installation to randomizer.

## Randomization

To randomize your AT3 copy...

```
• Run at3_random.exe
• Point the program to the data folder you wish to randomize
• Give seed and spoiler log preferences
• The program will randomize the item location data within the data folder
```
